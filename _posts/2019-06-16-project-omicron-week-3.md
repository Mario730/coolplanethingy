title: "Project Omicron Week 3 Blog Post"

For the entirety of week 3 I was working at my uncle's tire shop. This didn't allow me to dedicate much time to project omicron, but I did draw out a prototype for what I imagined the screen could look like. ![Drawing](/post_images/signal-drawing-jun16)

I tried to figure out what the entire screen could look like, so I considered where the health bar might go, what it might look like, and much more. In the drawing I put a minimap at the top to give the player a sense of where they are in the dungeon, but this might be an unlockable tool.
